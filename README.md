# Smart Campus Intelligence System

Production-style, multi-tenant campus intelligence platform built with Flask, PostgreSQL, and Render. The system combines role-based dashboards, placement-readiness analytics, AI advising, tenant isolation, audit logging, CSV operations, and production health checks into one portfolio-grade SaaS case study.

## Why This Project Exists

Most campus apps are CRUD portals. This project is designed like a real SaaS product: each institution has isolated data, admins can audit sensitive actions, faculty can identify at-risk students, and students get personalized placement-readiness guidance.

It is intentionally scoped as a portfolio and resume project for backend/product engineering interviews, especially companies that value production thinking: reliability, security, architecture, testing, deployment, and tradeoff awareness.

## Engineering Highlights

| Area | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-tenancy | Shared-schema SaaS model with `institutions`, `institution_id` scoping, tenant-aware auth payloads, and tenant isolation regression tests |
| Auth & Security | JWT via Bearer/cookie, bcrypt, OTP reset, token blacklist, timing-safe login, rate limiting, secure headers, proxy-aware cookies |
| Data Platform | PostgreSQL, migration runner, connection pooling, schema hardening, tenant-aware uniqueness constraints |
| Student Success | Readiness scoring, placement prediction, attendance, marks, mock tests, skills, goals, wellbeing, peer learning |
| AI | Gemini-backed student advisor and faculty insights, feature-gated by institution plan with safe fallback behavior |
| Enterprise Ops | Health checks, structured logging, request IDs, audit logs, CSV exports/imports, async report-job simulation |
| Deployment | Render Blueprint with managed PostgreSQL, Gunicorn, SSL DB mode, strict startup validation |
| Testing | 78 automated tests covering auth, readiness, tenant hardening, health endpoints, AI helpers, peer learning, and company matching |

## Architecture

PostgreSQL with migrations + pooled connections
```

Tenant context is resolved from subdomain/header/body for public auth flows, then enforced from the authenticated JWT institution for protected APIs. This prevents one campus from reading or mutating another campus's data.

## Key Features

- Student dashboard with placement-readiness score, trend insights, goals, alerts, and company matching.
- Faculty dashboard with class analytics, at-risk watchlist, interventions, classroom marks, and attendance management.
- Admin dashboard with users, departments, subjects, CSV exports/imports, audit logs, institution context, and async report jobs.
- Super-admin institution management for SaaS onboarding.
- AI assistant for student advice and faculty class insights, gated by plan tier.
- Production health endpoints: `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/health/startup`.

## API Examples

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | Login and receive JWT/cookie |
| `GET` | `/student/dashboard` | Student readiness dashboard |
| `GET` | `/faculty/summary` | Faculty class summary |
| `GET` | `/admin/exports/students` | Tenant-scoped CSV export |
| `POST` | `/admin/imports/students` | Tenant-scoped CSV import |
| `GET` | `/admin/audit-logs` | Sensitive action audit trail |
| `POST` | `/admin/reports/jobs` | Start async report job |
| `GET` | `/health/ready` | Readiness probe with DB check |

## Local Development

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 14+

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
python app.py
```

Seed demo data:

```bash
python scripts/seed_data.py
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Current baseline: `78 passed`.

## Render Deployment

This repo includes `render.yaml` for one-click deployment:

- Web service: Gunicorn via `wsgi:application`
- Database: Render managed PostgreSQL
- Health check: `/health/ready`
- Production env: `STRICT_STARTUP_VALIDATION=true`, `DB_SSL_MODE=require`, secure cookies

Deployment and demo guidance: [docs/DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md)

## Resume Bullets

- Built a production-style multi-tenant campus intelligence SaaS using Flask, PostgreSQL, JWT auth, and Render, supporting role-based dashboards for admins, faculty, and students.
- Implemented tenant isolation across protected APIs with institution-scoped data access, feature gating, audit logs, and regression tests to prevent cross-campus data leakage.
- Designed placement-readiness analytics using attendance, marks, skills, mock tests, goals, and AI-assisted advising to identify at-risk and placement-ready students.
- Added production hardening with migrations, connection pooling, secure headers, rate limiting, health checks, CSV operations, async report jobs, and 78 automated tests.

## Honest Scope

This is a strong portfolio/pilot-grade SaaS prototype, not a full enterprise SIS replacement. The next real production steps would be SSO, object storage, deeper audit coverage, backup/restore policy, observability dashboards, and integrations with existing SIS/LMS platforms.
